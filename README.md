# Jobby Job Job

Heroku takes 30 seconds to load the instance. After that, it's really very fast.

## Description

Jobby Job Job is a website that aggregates job postings from 4 different job boards.
The job boards are remote only jobs. You can specify and search for different jobs.
You can also view the original post.

Job posts are updated every hour using the Heroku scheduler to execute a rake
background task. The rake task builds the posts and creates the search indexes.
